# Build
The cmake system is used to build this project. It is recommended to build this project out of source. It means that you
can create a directory named build in root of project and build inside it and you are free to clear content of build
directory any time. Use these commands to build the project:

>$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
